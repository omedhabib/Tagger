# Tagger

## Overview

Tagger is a powerful JavaScript tool designed to capture specific URL parameters (such as UTM parameters) and store them as cookies. It dynamically inserts hidden input fields into all forms on a webpage and fills those fields with corresponding values from the cookies. This script is essential for marketers, sales teams, and affiliate partners to track and attribute user behavior originating from different campaigns and sources.

## Features

- **Attribution Tracking**: Build proper attribution for campaigns that originate traffic or influence user behavior.
- **Affiliate Relationships**: Ensure proper attribution for traffic originating from partners.
- **Sales Efforts**: Enable outbounding sales teams to receive attribution for leads they generate.
- **Customizable Expiration**: Set the cookie expiration to match your attribution needs.
- **Reliable Data Collection**: Capture data through form submissions, with considerations for data reliability.

## Installation

Include the script in the HTML file where you want to implement the tracking:

```html
<script src="path/to/Tagger.js"></script>
